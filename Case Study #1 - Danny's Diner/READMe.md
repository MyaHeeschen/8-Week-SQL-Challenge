## Business Objective
Danny's Diner is a small restaurant that sells three of Danny's favorite foods: sushi, curry, and ramen. Danny needs help to make sure he stays in business. Using the basic data from the first couple of months Danny's Diner has been in business, we will analyze the different customer trends to help deliver a better and more personalized experience.

Danny has given us three datasets to explore:
- sales
- menu
- members
